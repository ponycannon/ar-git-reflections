    committed, clarifies which files are being changed, only those selected will
    be committed saves errors if another file edited by mistake, or not wanting
    to be committed. Adds efficiency rather than committing a whole repository,
    especially if bit speeds up commits.

    branch remains as a kind of layby turn off then re-join bit.
